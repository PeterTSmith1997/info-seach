It was decided that a face to face interview/ meeting was the best way to get the requirements from the cllient. The meeting took the form of an unstructured interview so that it was easy to adapt the conversation based on what the client was saying, furthermore, unstructured interviews are useful when there is little information abot a topic (\cite{easwaramoorthy2006interviewing}).
